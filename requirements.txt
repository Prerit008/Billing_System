Here is a list of the requirements for the above code:

Python 3.5 or later: The code is written in Python, so you will need to have a compatible version of Python installed on your system in order to run it.

MySQL connector: The code uses the MySQL connector module to connect to a MySQL database. You will need to install this module in order to use the code. You can install it using pip by running pip install mysql-connector-python.

MySQL server: The code connects to a MySQL database, so you will need to have a MySQL server running on your machine or have access to a remote MySQL server. You will also need to have a user account with permission to create and modify databases and tables.

A MySQL database and table: The code assumes that a database named ebs and a table named consumer exist in the MySQL server. You will need to create these objects in the MySQL server before running the code.

User input: The code includes several functions that prompt the user for input, so you will need to provide this input when running the code.

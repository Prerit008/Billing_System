There are a few potential drawbacks or limitations to the current implementation of this program:

Security: The login function uses hard-coded values for the username and password, which is not a secure way to authenticate users. It would be better to use a more secure authentication method, such as prompting the user for their login credentials and storing hashed versions of these credentials in the database.

User input validation: The program does not currently perform any validation on user input, which could lead to issues if the user provides invalid or malformed input. For example, the add_consumer and modify_consumer functions assume that the user will always provide valid integer values for the vacc_no, vcontact, and vP_cost variables. If the user provides a non-integer value, the program will raise a ValueError exception.

Error handling: The program does not include any error handling code to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during execution. For example, if the database connection fails or if the program is unable to execute a SQL query, it will simply raise an exception and terminate. It would be better to include error handling code to handle these types of issues gracefully and provide more user-friendly error messages.

Code organization: The code in this program could be organized in a more modular and scalable way. Currently, all of the functions are defined in a single script, which could make it difficult to maintain and modify the code in the future. It might be helpful to split the code into separate modules or functions and use appropriate object-oriented design principles to make the code more maintainable and extensible.

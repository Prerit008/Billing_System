This code appears to be a command line program for managing a database of consumers for a utility company. The database is implemented using SQLite3 and the program allows users to login, list all consumers, add a new consumer, delete a consumer, modify a consumer, and generate a bill for a consumer.

The code first establishes a connection to an ebs.sql SQLite3 database, and creates a table named consumer with the following fields: acc_no, name, addr, contact, and P_cost. The acc_no field is defined as an integer with a size of 4 and is set as the primary key for the table.

The login() function allows a user to login with a username and password. The only valid login is with the username '1' and password '1', and all other combinations will result in an error message being printed.

The list_consumers() function lists all consumers stored in the consumer table by executing a SELECT query and printing the resulting records.

The add_consumer() function prompts the user for the fields of a new consumer and adds a new record to the consumer table with the provided information.

The del_consumer() function takes an acc_no as an argument and deletes the consumer with that account number from the consumer table.

The modify_consumer() function takes an acc_no as an argument and allows the user to modify the fields of the consumer with that account number in the consumer table.

The generate_bill() function takes an acc_no as an argument and generates a bill for the consumer with that account number by retrieving the consumer's information and power consumption from the consumer table and calculating the total cost using a user-provided rate for power. The bill is then printed to the console.
